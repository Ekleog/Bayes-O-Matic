# Bayes-O-Matic

This is a WASM webapp that can be used to model bayesian inference on Bayesian networks.

A live version of the app is available here: https://vberger.github.io/Bayes-O-Matic

An explanation of what Bayesian Networks are, how they can be used, and how to use
the app is available in-app via the "Help" button, or as a
[markdown file](https://github.com/vberger/Bayes-O-Matic/tree/master/static/help).
